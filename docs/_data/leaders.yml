Annmarie:
 name: Annmarie McKay
 bio: Annmarie came to Buddhist practice and meditation in 2013. It was her studies in psychology which led her to investigate mindfulness meditation, and from there she became interested in Buddhist practices and principles. She quickly felt that Theravada Buddhism and the Forest Sangha were the approaches that resonated most strongly with her and she focusses her current practice around these frameworks. The teachings of the Buddha are not just words and ideas but things that we can experience through practice, and for Annmarie this is where the joy of the practice comes from.

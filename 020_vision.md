# Land value tax is the solution#

## What is it? ##

Land value tax may replace council tax, and possibly even income tax and business rates. 

Land goes up in value as communities develop and improve on land. 

Any land holder benefits from this increase in the value of land. There limited taxes on land. Council tax was last revalued in the 1990s and smaller properties pay a larger percentage than bigger properties. In effect land holders profit from the developments and natural increase in land. 

For example, if a new railway station is built near a property, the property will increase in value due to the new convenience and improvements nearby. 

Land value tax is a way of capturing the value of these community improvements for the benefit of the community. 

## How will this help the housing crisis? ##

Land value tax may be small to begin with. Say for example 1% of the value of a property. The idea is land value tax could eventually match increases in the value of the property. 

This would disensentivise property speculation as any gains would be mostly be paid back in taxes. It would also make letting properties less attractive. 

## It will help the economy ##

With land value tax in place, those with money to invest can turn to businesses instead. This will increase productivity and innovation. 

With a high enough tax, land value tax may replace income tax, leaving individuals free to earn as much money as they can without paying any tax. Again this would incentivise people to work and stimulate the economy. 

## What about those that can't pay the tax ##

For those no longer working, pensioners may have less of a financial incentive to stay in homes for fear of missing out on the increase in value. They are less likely to loose money on the sale of a house. If they would rather not move, they can defer the tax until their death when the tax can be paid during the final evaluation of the estate.
